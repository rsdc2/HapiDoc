# HapiDoc

HapiDoc is a Haskell library for parsing and interacting with [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) XML
[EpiDoc](https://epidoc.stoa.org/) files.

PyEpiDoc has been designed for use, in the first instance, 
with the [I.Sicily](http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/) corpus.
For information on the encoding of I.Sicily texts in TEI EpiDoc, see
the [I.Sicily GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ISicily/ISicily/wiki).

**NB: HapiDoc is currently under active development.**
